My neural network project because I'm to lazy too install tensorflow

So far it's very basic, and you can do stuff but I've not made any preformance increases

If you want to run it yourself, use java version 18 because I haven't tested it in any other one.

Then, change the layers vars to your liking, then change the way that the ai gets rewards.

I wouldn't use this for your code, but if you want something that's very basic, you can use this one.
