# Neural_Networks_V1.0
My neural network project because I'm to lazy to install tensorflow \n
So far it's very basic, and broken because Idk I stole the code /n
If you want to run it yourself, use java version 18 because I haven't tested it in any other one. \n
Then, change the layers var to your liking, then change the way that the ai gets rewards. \n
I wouldn't use this for your code, because 1. it's very janky, 2. I don't even think it works, and 3. Very inefficient
